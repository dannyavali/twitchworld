        <p class="lead">TwitchToolkit is a mod written by Twitch.tv/hodlhodl that integrates storytelling decisions into chat votes, awards viewers coins for watching, and those coins can be spent on items/events in game.</p>

		<p>I am currently using Nesi's Rimvali mod, along with Reich Armory, a lot of the Vanilla Expanded mods, Soviet Armory, and more! Below you can find the list of purchaseable in game items. Click on the header of a row to sort by that variable (Note: Price sorting doesn't work at the moment.) When purchased, they will be sent to the colony using a drop pod, and I will have full control of the item from there.</p>

		<p>Use !bal to check your coin balance!</p>
		<p>Find the "itemname" of the item you want, and type in the Twitch chat:
		"!buy (itemname) (ammount)"</p>
		<p>ex: "!buy kidney 100" would send 100 kidneys to me. Minimum purchase worth 50 coins.</p>
	      
	        <p>Type !joinqueue to enter your name into the name-pool! This will give you a chance to have your own character in game! (Only one per person)</p>

		<p><b>Click on "Events" in the top bar to see the list of purchaseable events!</b></p>
